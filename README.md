# LeetCode Progress

This repository is dedicated to tracking my solutions to LeetCode problems, organized by language. Starting with Python, I plan to expand this to other languages as I progress.

## Repository Structure

- `python/` - Python solutions to LeetCode problems.

In the future:
- `go/` - Solutions written in Go.
- `sql/` - SQL queries for database-related problems.

## Usage

Each folder contains a solution file for each problem with detailed explanations in comments.

## Progress

I aim to add new solutions regularly, practicing across various problem types and expanding my language skills.
